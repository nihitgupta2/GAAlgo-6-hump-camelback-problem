where x and y lie between +/-5. The objective is to minimize z. The global minimum lies at
(-0.089840, 0.712659) or (0.089840, -0.712659) where z = -1.0316285. The global optimum to the problem is given for reference purpose. Do not use it in your solution methodology.
Assume we want to solve this problem using a simple (binary) GA algorithm.

Obtain three decimal points accuracy and represent the solutions in binary format. Code a simple GA algorithm to find a solution. Find final solution, plot the progress of the average population fitness and the best individual fitness against generation number.
